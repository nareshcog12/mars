    <h1>Some more info on 'The RED Planet'</h1>
    <p>
        Mars, often called the "Red Planet," is the fourth planet from the Sun and a terrestrial planet,<br>
        meaning it has a solid, rocky surface like Earth. Its distinctive reddish hue comes from iron minerals in its
        soil that have oxidized, or rusted. <br>
        Mars is about half the size of Earth, yet it shares several similarities, including seasons, polar ice caps, and
        dramatic landscapes featuring extinct volcanoes and extensive canyon systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mars has a very thin atmosphere, predominantly composed of carbon dioxide (about 95%), with smaller amounts of
        nitrogen and argon.,<br>
        This thin atmosphere provides little protection from solar radiation and allows for extreme temperature
        variations,<br>
        ranging from highs of 20°C to lows of -153°C.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mars is a frequent target for robotic exploration, with numerous orbiters, landers, and rovers sent by various
        space agencies. <br>
        These missions aim to understand Mars' geological history, search for signs of past or present life, and prepare
        for potential human exploration.<br>
        The discovery of water ice, both in the polar caps and beneath the surface, and evidence of ancient riverbeds
        continue to fuel scientific interest in the Red Planet's potential for habitability.
